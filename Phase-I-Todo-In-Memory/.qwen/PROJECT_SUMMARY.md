# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Complete the Phase I Todo In-Memory Python Console App with proper MVC architecture and documentation, ready for testing and review.

## Key Knowledge
- Phase I implementation is complete with all tasks in tasks.md marked as complete
- Application is structured as a Python package named "todo_console_app"
- Uses MVC architecture with separate model.py, service.py, view.py, and main.py files
- Task model implemented as a dataclass
- Includes comprehensive CRUD operations
- Supports separation of concerns principle
- Documentation includes quickstart.md, data-model.md, and research.md
- Previously confused /sp.implement as a shell command rather than workflow initiation tool

## Recent Actions
- Completed all tasks in tasks.md for Phase I Todo Console App
- Implemented MVC architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Created Task model as a dataclass in model.py
- Implemented comprehensive CRUD operations in service.py
- Created view.py for UI logic
- Created main.py as entry point
- Generated supporting documentation (quickstart.md, data-model.md, research.md)
- Structured application as a proper Python package

## Prompt

/sp.specify Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App **Target audience:** Developers evaluating Python console application structure **Focus:** CRUD operations with clean code practices and agentic development workflow **Success criteria:** - Implements all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) - Uses UV for dependency management and Python 3.13+ - Follows proper Python project structure and clean code principles - Developed entirely through agentic workflow (no manual coding) **Technology stack:** - Package manager: UV - Language: Python 3.13+ - Development tools: Claude Code with Spec-Kit Plus - No external libraries beyond standard library **Core functionality specifications:** 1. **Add Task:** Command to add new todos with description 2. **Delete Task:** Command to remove todos by ID or index 3. **Update Task:** Command to modify existing todo descriptions 4. **View Tasks:** Command to display all todos with status and IDs 5. **Mark Complete:** Command to toggle completion status **Data structure requirements:** - In-memory storage only (no database/file persistence) - Each task must have: ID, description, created timestamp, completed status - Tasks should persist only during application session **User interface requirements:** - Clear console menu with numbered options - Intuitive command prompts - Formatted output display - Error handling for invalid inputs **Development process constraints:** - Must use Agentic Dev Stack workflow - Process: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code - No manual coding allowed - all code must be generated by Claude - Must document all prompts and iterations **Project structure requirements:** - Proper Python package structure - Separate modules for different concerns - Type hints where appropriate - Docstrings for all functions - Clear separation of UI logic from business logic **Not building:** - File persistence or database integration - GUI or web interface - User authentication - Advanced sorting/filtering (beyond basic view) - Export/import functionality - Recurring tasks or reminders

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the feature branch `001-python-console-todo` and generated a detailed specification in `specs/001-python-console-todo/spec.md`. A quality checklist was also created and passed. The feature is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. Created a detailed, validated specification for the first phase of the project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 2 files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial attempt to run the setup script failed due to shell argument parsing issues. I successfully pivoted to a manual, step-by-step replication of the script's intended actions, which proved to be a robust workaround.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `run_shell_command` had persistent `ParameterBindingException` errors with a PowerShell script, likely due to complex argument parsing. Manual replication of the script's steps was a successful recovery.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: N/A
